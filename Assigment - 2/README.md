3. create the variable sum stored the 0 on it.

4. Now, Enter in for loop that range we asked from the user .

5. range(start-value, stop-value) and +1 the value for the range can going through the last value.

6. checking for loop condition and every iteration was stored in sum += i.

7. Then print The sum of number from start_value to end_value is , sum
